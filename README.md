MATLAB code animates 3-DOF robot based on user-input target coordinates, utilizing inverse kinematics.
The MATLAB code defines a 3-DOF robot, animates its motion along x, y, z axes based on user-input target coordinates, computes joint angles using inverse kinematics, and visualizes the trajectory in a video.
